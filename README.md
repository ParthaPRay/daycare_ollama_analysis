# Daycare Multimodal Reasoning Pipeline (Local Edge â€“ Ollama, YOLO, DeepFace)

This repository provides a research-grade, fully local pipeline for in-depth, evidence-based analysis of daycare images, running on resource-constrained edge devices or local servers. It combines **[YOLO object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/)**, **[DeepFace emotion analysis](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)**, a local **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and a reasoning **Judge Model** (LLM) for robust, explainable scene understanding and automated judgment.

---

## Key Features

* **YOLO + DeepFace**: Detects people, relevant objects, and assesses facial emotions in daycare scenes.
* **VLM (Qwen/Gemma/Moondream, etc.) via Ollama**: Provides detailed, structured, and evidence-based image analysis.
* **Judge/Reasoner Model**: Cross-verifies outputs and delivers final quantitative, qualitative, and risk/safety assessmentâ€”authoritative, explainable, and research-focused.
* **Fully Local**: No cloud calls; runs on your local network or edge device.
* **Extensible**: Swap models (YOLO weights, VLM, Judge) as needed.

---

## Pipeline Overview

1. **YOLO + DeepFace** (`yolo_deepface.py`):
   Detects all persons, objects, risky items, and faces in the image. Analyzes emotions for each face. Outputs:

   * Annotated image with emotion labels and detection boxes.
   * A JSON file summarizing people, objects, and detected emotions.

2. **VLM Analysis** (`vlm.py`):
   Sends the image and a detailed prompt to a local VLM via Ollamaâ€™s HTTP API (e.g., Qwen2.5VL, Gemma). Produces:

   * A comprehensive, structured textual analysis (JSON).

3. **Reasoning Judge** (`judge_module.py`):
   Invokes a local LLM (e.g., DeepSeek, Qwen3) to:

   * Integrate VLM and YOLO+DeepFace outputs.
   * Deliver a final judgment with quantitative/qualitative summary, risk assessment, discrepancies, and actionable recommendations (JSON).

4. **Orchestrator** (`daycare_pipeline.py`):
   Runs all stages in sequence, passing outputs as inputs, handling files, and ensuring reproducibility.

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
python daycare_pipeline.py
```

* Edit `daycare_pipeline.py` to set your input image, model names, and backends as needed.
* Outputs are saved in respective folders:

  * `yolodeepface_output/`
  * `vlm_output/`
  * `judge_output/`

**Each output includes a `.json` result for downstream analysis or auditability.**

## Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running (for VLM and judge models)
* All dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

  ```text
  ultralytics
  deepface
  tf-keras
  opencv-python
  requests
  numpy
  pillow
  # For Gradio interface (optional): gradio
  ```
* Download or place your YOLO weights (e.g., `yolo11x.pt`) in the working directory.
* Place input images in the `images/` folder.

**For Gradio web UI (optional), see `daycare_pipeline_gradio.py` (not included here but supported by the requirements).**

---

## How to Run

### 1. **Start Ollama**

Make sure [Ollama](https://ollama.com) is running locally and you have pulled required models, e.g.:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b
ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
```

### 2. **Place Image**

Put your daycare image in the `images/` folder.

### 3. **Edit Pipeline Variables**

Open `daycare_pipeline.py` and edit:

```python
image_path = "images/your_image.jpg"
yolo_model = "yolo11x.pt"
deepface_backend = "retinaface"  # or your preferred backend
vlm_model = "qwen2.5vl:7b"
judge_model = "deepseek-r1:1.5b"
```

### 4. **Run the Pipeline**

```bash
python daycare_pipeline.py
```

Outputs will be saved in their respective folders, and youâ€™ll see logs in the console.

---

## Output Details

* **YOLO+DeepFace JSON**: Counts, boxes, detected items, face emotion summaries.
* **VLM JSON**: Structured, sectioned report as per research-grade prompt (see `vlm.py`).
* **Judge JSON**: Final, evidence-based judgment, including discrepancies, safety assessment, and confidence metrics.

---

## Notes

* All steps are strictly **evidence-based**; no speculation is permitted by design.
* You may swap VLM and judge models (Gemma, Moondream, Qwen3, etc.) as long as they are supported by Ollama.
* Runs fully offline (except model downloads).
